            <h2>Finding correlation between heart rate and frustration</h2>
            <p>In this blog we examined the interaction between frustration levels and heart rate during two-person 
                puzzle-solving tasks. We employed statistical tests to determine assumptions and thereafter conducted 
                further testing to find that there was no statistically significant effect of frustration on the proxy
                 heart rate metrics...</p>

            <h2>Regression and classification on french wine</h2>
            <p>In this blog, we delve into an insightful exploration of machine learning and data mining techniques applied to a wine dataset, aimed at predicting alcohol content and classifying wine cultivators. We harness a dataset comprising 178 wine instances from three different Italian cultivators, analyzed through features such as alcohol percentage, malic acid, and phenols. The study employs methods including linear regression with regularization and artificial neural networks (ANNs), underpinned by cross-validation for error estimation. Our findings...</p>

            <h2>AI Pacman with deep-Q-learning</h2>
            <p>This blog is about the game Pac-man's mechanics, the essential mechanic of avoiding
                a ghost in a maze. It is relevant, because if we can get an Ai to solve one mechanic of a game
                then we can build an Ai to solve multiple mechanics and problems. In this blog we have
                chosen to research, how well a deep-Q-network Ai can survive a single ghost dependent on
                different amounts of learning. Both the ghost and Ai agent will spawn in random locations and
                the ghosts movement is random as opposed to the real Pac-man game....</p>

            <h2>Data Processing of ETF's in R</h2>
            <p>his blog post explores a comprehensive statistical analysis project conducted on a dataset comprising weekly returns of 95 ETFs over a span of 454 weeks from May 2006 to May 2015. The analysis delves into data quality, empirical distribution, and performance metrics of selected ETFs, leveraging statistical methods...</p>
